module.exports = `Parrot, Parrot.

Hi, I'm Parrot and I will transcribe everything you'll say. Add me to your group conversation.
Use voice message and I will listen and post what you've said.

I'm better than your smartphones speech-to-text function.
Why? Because:

* You have best out of both worlds (audio & text).
* Often you can’t listen to a voice message because you are in public or don’t want anyone else to listen.
* It is fully searchable not like audio.
* You can use your intonation in voice messages. This information will be lost if only text is transferred.
* Speech-to-text is failure prone. Sometimes the output text is rubbish but you can listen to the audio track as fallback.`;
